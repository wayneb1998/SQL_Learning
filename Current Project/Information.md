I am currently working on analysing a sales dataset in SQL - both through the shell and pgAdmin4. I am also using PowerBI and Excel for visualisation.

Due to time constraints and other commitments it may seem that my SQL_Learning is pretty empty.

I am still learning, I just need to make the time to create the files and display the project.
